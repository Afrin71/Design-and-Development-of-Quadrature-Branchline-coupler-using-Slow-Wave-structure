In this project, a directional  coupler is designed with FR4 epoxy used as substrate material. The suggested coupler uses artficial transmission lines and a symmetrical layout of a perfect serpentine. The proposed coupler is designed using HFSS and then fabricated. 
It offers advantages such as design accuracy, low loss performance and ease of fabrication. It's operating frequency is 1.3 GHz. 
The proposed coupler can be  used as power divider and used for Bone Density Measurement Analysis (BDAS), to develop an embedded system for diagnosis and monitoring of healing of fractures in home care environment.
